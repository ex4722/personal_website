**Eddie Xiao**

Hello World! I'm Eddie Xiao. 

I'm a hacker interested VR/RE shit. I'm experienced with memory corruption, heap exploitation, kernel exploitation and much more. I'm interested in fuzzing, automation, ML security and tool development. 
I love linux RICEing and I'm a die hard Neovim fanatic.

I'm from NYC and I am currently a freshman studying Computer Science at RIT. In my spare time you will find me skateboarding, rock climbing or blasting death metal.
